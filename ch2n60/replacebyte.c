  "Suppose we number the bytes in a w-bit word from 0 (least significant) to w/8 âˆ’ 1
  (most significant). Write code for the following C function, which will return an
  unsigned value in which byte i of argument x has been replaced by byte b:

  unsigned replace_byte (unsigned x, int i, unsigned char b);

  Here are some examples showing how the function should work:
    replace_byte(0x12345678, 2, 0xAB) --> 0x12AB5678
    replace_byte(0x12345678, 0, 0xAB) --> 0x123456AB"
